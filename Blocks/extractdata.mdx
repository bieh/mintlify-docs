With the help of this block, we inform the agent exactly what information from the page and in what format we want to receive.

If from each page from which we need to extract data, we want to get data for a single object (for example, the agent is on a product page in an online store and we need the price of this single product, its size, and so on), you need to select **A single item**. 

If from each page we need to extract several objects (for example, reviews about a company on Google Maps or Trustpilot) - you need to select **A list of items**.

After selection, we fill in the table to show the AI agent in what format we want to receive data from the page. 

The first column is the names of the elements to be extracted; they can be anything and are not necessarily related to the item being extracted, provided that the explanations in the right column are comprehensive enough to understand what you want to see in the final result of the agent's work. 

The second column is explanations; it is not necessary to fill it in if the element name is simple and the data that needs to be entered here is obvious. \
The more detailed the explanation is filled in, plus examples are added, the more accurate the data extracted by the agent will be. 

Below the table, you can add general additional instructions for the AI agent on how to fill in the table. If it can help, add context that the agent should consider when filling in the table. The more detailed you describe to the agent what you want to get, the more accurately it will extract the data from the page.

Advanced mode allows you to write a data extraction scheme in JSON format. This approach allows technically savvy users to fine-tune the format, for example, by adding nested elements.

This block supports the use of variables. Also, if multiple Extract data blocks are used sequentially in the workflow, then the field names from the previous blocks can be used as new variables in the blocks that follow.
