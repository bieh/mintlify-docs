The `Webhook out` block acts as an **Output** for your workflow. It allows you to automatically send the final, collected data from your workflow to a specified URL. This enables you to integrate Jsonify's results directly into your own applications, databases, or other automation platforms like Make.

This block is typically placed at the very end of a workflow, after all data has been collected and structured.

## Purpose

Use the `Webhook out` block to:

- Send extracted data to your own custom API endpoint to be saved in a database.
- Trigger actions in other applications (e.g., create a new record in a CRM) by sending the data to a service like Make.
- Integrate Jsonify with almost any external system that can receive incoming webhooks.
- Automatically pass your workflow's results to another script or application for further processing.

## Configuration

1. **Paste a webhook URL below:**
   - This is the primary input field where you must provide the URL of the external system that will receive the data.
   - This URL is often called a "Webhook URL" or "Endpoint," and you'll get it from the application you want to send data _to_.
   - For example, if you're using Make, you would create a Scenario with a "Custom webhook" trigger, and Make would provide you with a unique URL to paste here.
