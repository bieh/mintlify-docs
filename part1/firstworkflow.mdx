Let's jump right in and build your first automation with Jsonify! This simple workflow will open a specific webpage and extract its title. This demonstrates the core "Open -> Extract" pattern fundamental to many automations.

## Steps

### 1. Create a New Workflow

* Navigate to your Jsonify **Dashboard**.
* Click the button sequence to create a new workflow: **Create an empty workflow âž™ Extract**.
* Notice that the created workflow already contains the necessary blocks (`Open Websites` and `Extract Data`) for this first example.

### 2. Configure the `Open Websites` Block

* The starting point for this workflow is the **`Open Websites`** block, which is already on the canvas.
* Select the `Open Websites` block to configure it.
* In the URL input field, enter the website you want the AI Agent to visit. Let's use a simple, stable example: `https://example.com`
* Ensure the toggle switch next to the URL is **ON**.

### 3. Configure the `Extract Data` Block

* Next, we need to tell the agent what to extract. The **`Extract Data`** block is already placed after the `Open Websites` block on the canvas.
* Select the `Extract Data` block to configure it.
* We want a single piece of data (the title) for this example, so ensure **"A single item"** is selected.
* Define the data point you want:
    * In the first column, labeled **NAME**, type `page_title`.
    * In the second column, labeled **EXAMPLE VALUE OR A LONGER DESCRIPTION**, describe what the AI should extract: `Extract the main title of the webpage`.
* *(Optional)* You could add further clarification in the "Add additional instructions" field below, like: `Extract only the text content of the main page title.`

### 4. Run Your Workflow!

* That's it! Your simple workflow is configured and ready to run.
* Find and click the **Run** button (often located at the top right or bottom of the editor).
* Jsonify will assign an AI Agent to open `example.com` and extract its title based on your instructions.

### 5. Check the Results

* Once the workflow finishes (it should be very quick for this example), you can view the results.
* Navigate to the results area. You might click on the **Running** status indicator if the workflow is still active, or the **Results** tab/section if it has completed.
* You should see the extracted data, likely presented in a table, with a column named `page_title` containing the text "Example Domain".

**Congratulations!** You've successfully configured and run your first Jsonify workflow using a template. This demonstrates the basic process of navigating to a page and extracting specific information. You can now build upon this foundation to tackle more complex tasks.
