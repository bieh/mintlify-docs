The `Explore Content` block gives your AI Agent more autonomy. Instead of providing exact links or actions, you give the agent a **goal**, and it will attempt to navigate the current website to find pages relevant to that goal. This is useful when you don't know the exact URLs where information resides but can describe what you're looking for.

## Purpose

Use the `Explore Content` block when you want your AI Agent to:

* Find specific types of pages within a website (e.g., "Find the contact page," "Locate pages about pricing").
* Discover information that might be spread across several internal pages.
* Explore a section of a website to gather context before extracting specific data.
* Navigate Google search results to find the most relevant link based on a query.

## Configuration

1.  **Describe an action or set of actions below. Jsonify will follow the instructions to navigate the site:**
    * This is the primary input field where you define the **goal** for the AI Agent.
    * Be clear and specific. For example:
        * "Find the page which may contain the company's contact information."
        * "Explore product detail pages for smartphones."
        * "Open search results that seem most relevant to 'AI in healthcare'."
    * You can use variables from an `Apply Variables` block here (e.g., "Find pages about {{topic}}").

2.  **How many pages to open? (Maximum number of pages):**
    * This sets a limit on the total number of new pages the agent can open during its exploration for the current goal.
    * This is a general limitation for the entire interaction of the agent with the initial page for this specific `Explore Content` block instance.
    * Default is often a reasonable number (e.g., 5 or 10), but adjust based on the complexity of the site and your goal.

3.  **Depth to explore:**
    * This controls how "deep" the agent can go by clicking links from one page to another.
    * A depth of 1 means it will only explore links found on the initial page(s) it started from (or was on when this block activated).
    * A depth of 2 means it can click links on the initial page, and then click links on *those* subsequent pages, and so on.
    * This helps prevent the agent from getting lost in "rabbit holes" or navigating too far away from relevant content.

## Examples

**Example 1: Finding a Company's "About Us" Page**

* **Goal:** "Find the page that describes the company's mission or history (About Us page)."
* **Max Pages:** 5
* **Depth:** 2
* *Result:* The agent will navigate the current website, trying to identify and open the "About Us" page or similar.

**Example 2: Exploring Blog Posts on a Specific Topic**

* Assumes the agent is on a blog's main page.
* **Goal:** "Find and open blog articles related to 'artificial intelligence'."
* **Max Pages:** 10
* **Depth:** 3
* *Result:* The agent will look for links to articles matching the topic and navigate to them.

**Example 3: Processing Google Search Results**

* Assumes the previous block was `Search on Google` for "best CRM software".
* **Goal:** "From these search results, open the pages that are reviews or comparison articles for CRM software."
* **Max Pages:** 3 (to open the top few relevant results)
* **Depth:** 1 (only open links directly from the search results page)
* *Result:* The agent will analyze the search result links and titles and open the most promising ones.

## Key Considerations

* **Clarity of Goal:** The more specific and clear your goal description, the better the agent will perform.
* **Website Structure:** Performance can vary depending on how well-structured and navigable the target website is.
* **Limits are Important:** `Max Pages` and `Depth` help control the scope and prevent excessive navigation, saving time and resources.
* **Use in Sequence:** This block is often followed by an `Extract Data` block to get information from the pages the agent discovered.

The `Explore Content` block adds a layer of intelligence to your workflows, allowing for more flexible and adaptive web automation.
