 A super simple block that allows you to find links on the current page. 

So, if the agent is on a page with a list of items and you need it to navigate to each item's page or find the page of a specific item, you should use this block. Simply write in the text field which links you want to find.

For example, if we are on a page with a list of companies and need to open each company's page to get more information about them, we add two blocks sequentially: \
1. **Find Links** – where we specify which pages we want to find, in this case: _Find links to each company's page_. \
2. **Follow Links** – which is needed for the agent to navigate to the found links.
