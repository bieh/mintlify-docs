The `Explore Content` block gives your AI Agent more autonomy. Instead of providing exact links or actions, you give the agent a **goal**, and it will attempt to navigate the current website to find pages relevant to that goal. This is useful when you don't know the exact URLs where information resides but can describe what you're looking for.

## Purpose

Use the `Explore Content` block when you want your AI Agent to:

* Find specific types of pages within a website (e.g., "Find the contact page," "Locate pages about pricing").
* Discover information that might be spread across several internal pages.
* Explore a section of a website to gather context or **extract generalized information from multiple pages** (e.g., summarizing Google search results).
* Navigate Google search results to find the most relevant link based on a query.

This block is typically used **before** an `Extract Data` block if the aim is to gather specific details from the pages found during exploration.
