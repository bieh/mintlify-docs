What if we complicate the task a bit and not only collect the names of all Websummit speakers, but also find their LinkedIn profiles automatically? Let's build a step-by-step workflow that will do all this dirty work. 

Create an empty extraction workflow via Dashboard

In the first block, click the "\+ Add" button on the right to select a URL addition mode that will automatically create unique links to each page using a pattern.

Add a link to the page. Inside the link, replace the page number with the variable {{page}} (you can copy it by clicking on it at the top) and specify the page range for generating links.

The result will be a list of links to each page with the corresponding number.
