This block allows you to specify actions for the agent on a page. Actions must be specified sequentially and have a clear algorithm. Each new action should be written on a new line. Here you can ask to: 

- click on a spoiler to show more information 
- enter a query in the search field on the website (using variables is allowed) 
- press Enter on the keyboard, or a key combination 

In this block, there is no need to ask the agent to scroll the page to the desired location. The agent always sees and perceives the entire page.

In the advanced settings, you can enable vision for the agent; by default, it only perceives text on the page, and on some websites, buttons may not have a textual description.
