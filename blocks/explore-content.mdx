The `Explore Content` block gives your AI Agent more autonomy. Instead of providing exact links or actions, you give the agent a **goal**, and it will attempt to navigate the current website to find pages relevant to that goal. This is useful when you don't know the exact URLs where information resides but can describe what you're looking for.
