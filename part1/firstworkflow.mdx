Let's jump right in and build your first automation with Jsonify! This simple workflow will open a specific webpage and extract its title. This demonstrates the core "Open -> Extract" pattern fundamental to many automations.

## Steps

### 1. Create a New Workflow

* Navigate to your Jsonify **Dashboard**.
* Click the button to create a New workflow: **Create an empty workflow âž™ Extract**.
* Give your workflow a descriptive name, like "Extract Example Title".

*[Optional: Insert a screenshot of creating a new workflow]*

### 2. Add the `Open Websites` Block

* Every workflow needs a starting point. Drag the **`Open Websites`** block onto the workflow canvas.
* Select the `Open Websites` block to configure it.
* In the URL input field, enter the website you want the AI Agent to visit. Let's use a simple, stable example: `https://example.com`
* Ensure the toggle next to the URL is **ON**.

### 3. Add the `Extract Data` Block

* Now, tell the agent what to do after opening the page. Drag the **`Extract Data`** block onto the canvas *after* the `Open Websites` block. A line should connect them, showing the sequence.
* Select the `Extract Data` block to configure it.
* We want a single piece of data (the title), so ensure **"A single item"** (or similar) is selected.
* Define the data point you want:
    * In the first column (often "NAME" or "Field"), type `page_title`.
    * In the second column (often "DESCRIPTION" or "Instructions"), describe what the AI should extract: `Extract the main title of the webpage`.
* (Optional) Add additional instructions if needed, like: `Extract only the text content of the main page title.`

### 4. Run Your Workflow!

* That's it! Your simple workflow is ready.
* Find and click the **"Run"** button for your workflow.
* Jsonify will assign an AI Agent to open `example.com` and extract its title based on your instructions.

### 5. Check the Results

* Once the workflow finishes (it should be very quick for this example), navigate to your **Dashboard** or Results area.
* You should see the extracted data, likely in a table format, with a column named `page_title` containing the text "Example Domain".

**Congratulations!** You've successfully built and run your first Jsonify workflow, demonstrating the basic process of navigating to a page and extracting specific information. You can now build upon this foundation to tackle more complex tasks.
