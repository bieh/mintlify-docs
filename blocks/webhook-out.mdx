The `Webhook out` block acts as an **Output** for your workflow. It allows you to automatically send the final, collected data from your workflow to a specified URL. This enables you to integrate Jsonify's results directly into your own applications, databases, or other automation platforms like Make.

This block is typically placed at the very end of a workflow, after all data has been collected and structured.

## Purpose

Use the `Webhook out` block to:

- Send extracted data to your own custom API endpoint to be saved in a database.
- Trigger actions in other applications (e.g., create a new record in a CRM, post a message to Slack) by sending the data to a service like Make.
- Integrate Jsonify with almost any external system that can receive incoming webhooks.
- Automatically pass your workflow's results to another script or application for further processing.
