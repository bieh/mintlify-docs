The `Open datasets` block is the primary way to introduce structured, tabular data into your workflow. It allows you to create or import one or more datasets. The workflow then iterates through a combined set of all enabled datasets, making the data from each row available as variables to subsequent blocks.

This block acts as a powerful starting point, enabling you to run the same workflow logic across many different inputs.

## Purpose

Use the `Open datasets` block to:

- Run a workflow for a list of items (e.g., company names, product URLs, search keywords).
- Import data from a CSV file to be processed.
- Manage multiple distinct sets of input data within a single workflow block.
- Provide the variables needed for dynamic automation in subsequent steps.

## Configuration

The main configuration panel for the `Open datasets` block shows a list of available datasets for the workflow.

1. **Dataset List View:**
   - **ENABLED:** A checkbox to include or exclude a specific dataset from the workflow run. The workflow will only process rows from datasets that are enabled.
   - **DATASET NAME:** The name of the dataset. By default, the first one is named "Default". You can rename it. Clicking on the dataset name (e.g., on "Default") opens the full-screen data table editor for that dataset.
   - **ROWS:** Shows the number of data rows in that dataset.
   - **\+ Add Dataset Button:** Click this to create a new, empty dataset in the list.
2. **Data Table Editor (Full-screen view):**
   - After clicking a dataset name, a full-screen table editor opens. This is where you manage the data for that specific dataset.
   - **Columns as Variable Names:** Each column header you define becomes a variable name (e.g., `URL`, `company_name`, `search_keyword`). Remember, these names are **case-sensitive**.
   - **Rows as Value Sets:** Each row in the table represents a distinct set of values for these variables.
   - **Import Button:** Use this to upload data from a CSV file into the current dataset. The first row of your CSV will be used as the column headers (variable names).
   - **Clone Button:** Creates a duplicate of the current dataset.

## How It Works

1. You define one or more datasets within the `Open datasets` block.
2. You enable the datasets you wish to use for the run.
3. When the workflow runs, it combines all the rows from all **enabled** datasets into a single master list.
4. The workflow then iterates through each row of this combined list. For each row, the values are assigned to variables (e.g., `{{URL}}`, `{{company_name}}`), and the subsequent blocks are executed using these variables.

## Special Column Name: `URL`

If you name a column exactly `URL` (case-sensitive) and provide valid, complete URLs (starting with `http://` or `https://`) in its rows, the AI Agent will automatically open each of these URLs. In this specific case, a subsequent `Open Websites` block is not required to open these particular URLs.

## Example: Processing URLs from Two Datasets

1. **`Open datasets Block:`**
   - **Dataset 1 ("Competitors"):** Enabled. Contains a `URL` column with links to competitor websites.
   - **Dataset 2 ("Partners"):** Enabled. Also contains a `URL` column with links to partner websites.
   - **Dataset 3 ("Old_Data"):** Disabled. Contains old URLs that should not be processed.
2. **`Extract Data Block (added next):`**
   - Configured to extract the `<title>` tag from each page.

- **Result:** The workflow will first process all URLs from the "Competitors" dataset, then all URLs from the "Partners" dataset. The `Extract Data` block will run for each URL from both enabled datasets, and the results will show the page titles for all of them. The "Old_Data" dataset will be ignored.

## Key Considerations

- **Variable Names are Case-Sensitive:** `{{url}}` is different from `{{URL}}`. Ensure consistency.
- **Combined Datasets:** The workflow processes a combined list from all _enabled_ datasets. The order of processing usually follows the order of datasets in the list and the order of rows within each dataset.
- **Primary Data Source:** This block is a fundamental data source. It initiates the iterative execution of the workflow for each row of data it provides.
