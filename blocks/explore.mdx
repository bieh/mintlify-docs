A block that empowers an agent with freedom of action on a page, without specific instructions, but with a clear goal. In this case, the agent needs to find a page on the company's website that may contain contact information. Upon entering the website, the agent will independently assume in which section of the site the information it is tasked with finding might be located. Below the text field with the goal, there are two parameters that can be set for the agent:

1. Maximum number of pages it can open after entering the website. This is a general limitation on the entire interaction of the agent with the initial page. If the goal is simple, as in our case, the default value will suffice.
2. Depth to explore means how deeply the agent can delve into the website.\
   To easily understand the principle of this parameter, it is enough to recall the popular "Wikipedia rabbit hole" meme. The essence of the meme is that a person goes to Wikipedia to find something simple and specific, for example, "who invented the telephone," but after a few clicks on hyperlinks ends up in a completely unexpected article about alpaca breeding in Peru or about the physics of quantum particles.\
   By setting this parameter, we simply limit the agent in the depth of such journeys.

It is also permissible to use this block for exploring Google search results. The agent will open several search results to find the target data for extraction.
