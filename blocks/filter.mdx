The `Filter results` block acts as an intelligent gatekeeper in your workflow. It allows you to inspect the data or content provided by a source block (like `Open datasets` or `Read RSS feeds`) and decide whether the workflow should proceed to the data extraction phase for a specific item.

This is essential for creating efficient and focused automations. By filtering upfront, you ensure that resource-intensive extraction blocks like `Find Links` or `Extract Data` only run on relevant items.

## Purpose

Use the `Filter results` block **before** an extraction step to:

* Process only the items from a data source that contain specific keywords.
* Filter content based on a date (e.g., only process articles published after a certain date).
* Use AI to apply a complex, descriptive filter to text (e.g., only pass through items with a "positive sentiment").
* Prevent the workflow from running extraction on irrelevant data, saving time and resources.

## Configuration

The block's configuration is centered around a dropdown menu that lets you choose the filtering method. After you select an option that requires input, a text field will appear to specify the condition.

1.  **Dropdown Menu Options:**
    * **No filter, pass through all changes:** This is the default state. The block will not perform any filtering, and all items from the previous step will be passed through.
    * **Look for specific keywords (one per line):** After selecting this, a text field appears. Provide a list of keywords, one per line. An item will pass the filter if its content contains **at least one** of the specified keywords.
    * **Describe the filter in English, and filter with AI:** After selecting this, a text field appears. Provide a natural language instruction describing your filtering criteria. The AI will analyze the item's content and determine if it matches your description.
        * **Example condition:** `The text should be a positive customer review` or `The article must be about financial technology (fintech)`.
    * **The content must mention a specific date or time which must be after...:** After selecting this, a date/time picker appears. An item will pass the filter only if its content contains a date that is more recent than the one you specified.

## How It Works

1.  A source block like `Open datasets` or `Read RSS feeds` provides a list of items to process.
2.  The `Filter results` block is placed immediately after the source block.
3.  For each item in the list, the `Filter results` block applies your chosen rule.
4.  If the item **passes** the filter, the workflow continues to the next block (which must be a data extraction block like `Find Links` or `Extract Data`).
5.  If the item **does not pass** the filter, the workflow stops for that specific item and moves on to the next one in the list, skipping the extraction step.

## Example: Processing Only Relevant News Articles

Imagine a workflow that monitors a news RSS feed but should only analyze articles about a specific company.

1.  **`Read RSS feeds` Block:**
    * Configured to fetch the latest 10 articles from a news source.
2.  **`Filter results` Block (added next):**
    * **Filter method chosen:** `Look for specific keywords (one per line)`
    * **Add the filter condition here:**
        ```
        Jsonify
        OpenAI
        ```
3.  **`Extract Data` Block (added next):**
    * Configured to summarize the article content.

* **Result:** The workflow will check all 10 articles from the RSS feed. Only articles containing "Jsonify" or "OpenAI" will be passed to the `Extract Data` block for summarization. The other articles will be skipped.

## Key Considerations

* **Placement is Crucial:** This block **must be placed before** a data extraction block (`Find Links` or `Extract Data`) and after a block that provides a list of items to process.
* **AI vs. Keywords:** For simple text matching, the keyword filter is fast and precise. For more nuanced filtering based on meaning, context, or sentiment, the descriptive AI filter is much more powerful.
* **Efficiency:** Using a filter early in your workflow is a key strategy for efficiency, as it prevents extraction blocks from running on irrelevant data.

The `Filter results` block allows you to add powerful conditional logic to your automations, making them smarter and more efficient.
