This glossary defines common terms you will encounter while using Jsonify.

### A

**Agent (AI Agent)**
The AI-powered entity that executes your workflow. It's the "robot" that navigates websites, interacts with pages, and extracts data based on your instructions.

**Attribute**
A single named field within a data extraction schema. For example, in a schema to extract user information, `user_name` and `email_address` would be attributes.

### B

**Block**
The fundamental building block of a workflow. Each block represents a specific action or step, such as `Open Websites`, `Extract Data`, or `Filter results`. Blocks are connected sequentially to define the workflow's logic.

### D

**Dataset**
A table of data within the `Open datasets` block. It contains rows and columns, where each column represents a variable and each row represents a set of values for an iteration.

### E

**Extraction**
The process of pulling specific pieces of information from a source, such as a webpage or a document. This is primarily done using the `Extract Data` block.

### F

**Filter**
A block (`Filter results`) that adds conditional logic to a workflow. It inspects data and allows the workflow to continue only for items that meet the specified criteria.

### I

**Input**
A category of blocks that provide the initial data for a workflow. This can be a list of URLs (`Open Websites`), a set of variables (`Open datasets`), a search query (`Search on Google`), or uploaded files.

**Interaction**
A single action performed by the agent on a webpage, such as a `click`, `type`, or `press`. Blocks like `Interact with Page` and `Explore Content` use a budget of interactions.

**Iteration**
A single pass through a loop in a workflow. For example, if you provide 10 URLs in an `Open datasets` block, the workflow will perform 10 iterations, one for each URL.

### M

**Merge**
A feature within the `Extract Data` block (in advanced mode) that allows you to combine existing variables from previous extraction steps with newly extracted data into a single, unified result.

### O

**Output**
A category of blocks that send the final results of your workflow to an external system. For example, `Webhook out` sends data to a specified URL.

### R

**Run**
A single, complete execution of a workflow from its trigger to its end. Each run has a unique ID and produces a set of results.

### S

**Schema**
The structure you define for the data you want to extract, typically within an `Extract Data` block. It consists of a set of attributes (fields) that the agent will populate.

### T

**Transform**
A category of blocks that perform an action to process, change, or navigate based on the current context. This is the largest category, including blocks like `Extract Data`, `Interact with Page`, and `Find Links`.

**Trigger**
A block that initiates a workflow run. A workflow can only have one trigger, such as `Start on a timer` or `Start on incoming webhook`.

### V

**Variable**
A named placeholder for a piece of data (e.g., `{{company_name}}`). Variables allow you to make your workflows dynamic by using data from input blocks (like `Open datasets`) or previous extraction steps in subsequent blocks.

### W

**Workflow**
A sequence of connected blocks that defines a complete automation task. It starts with a trigger, processes data through a series of actions, and (optionally) ends with an output.
