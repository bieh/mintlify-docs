Let's jump right in and build your first automation with Jsonify\! This simple workflow will open a specific webpage and extract its title. This demonstrates the core "Open -\> Extract" pattern fundamental to many automations.

## Steps

### 1. Create a New Workflow

- Navigate to your Jsonify **Dashboard**.
- Click the button sequence to create a new workflow: **Create an empty workflow âž™ Extract**.
- Notice that the created workflow already contains the necessary blocks (`Open Websites` and `Extract Data`) for this first example.

### 2. Configure the `Open Websites` Block

- The starting point for this workflow is the `Open Websites` block, which is already on the canvas.
- Select the `Open Websites` block to configure it.
- In the URL input field, enter the website you want the AI Agent to visit. Let's use a simple, stable example: `https://example.com`
- Ensure the toggle switch next to the URL is **ON**.

### 3. Configure the `Extract Data` Block

- Next, we need to tell the agent what to extract. The `Extract Data` block is already placed after the `Open Websites` block on the canvas.
- Select the `Extract Data` block to configure it.
- We want a single piece of data (the title) for this example, so ensure **"A single item"** is selected.
- Define the data point you want:
  - In the first column, labeled **NAME**, type `title`.
  - In the second column, labeled **EXAMPLE VALUE OR A LONGER DESCRIPTION**, describe what the AI should extract: `Extract the main title of the webpage`.
- _(Optional)_ You could add further clarification in the "Add additional instructions" field below, like: `Extract only the text content of the main page title.`

### 4. Run Your Workflow\!

- That's it\! Your simple workflow is configured and ready to run.
- Find and click the **Run** button (located at the top right of the editor).
- Jsonify will assign an AI Agent to open `example.com` and extract its title based on your instructions.

### 5. Check the Results

- When you manually run the workflow, the editor will automatically redirect you to the page for the current run.
- On this page, results will appear as the AI agent works.
- Once the workflow finishes (it should be very quick for this example), click on **"View as sheet"**. You should see the extracted data presented in a table, with a columns named `title` containing the text "Example Domain" and `url` containing the link to the page were the data was extracted.

**Congratulations\!** You've successfully configured and run your first Jsonify workflow using a template. This demonstrates the basic process of navigating to a page and extracting specific information. You can now build upon this foundation to tackle more complex tasks.
