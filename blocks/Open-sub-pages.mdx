The `Open sub-pages` block is a specialized tool designed for navigating to a list of similar items (like products in a catalog or articles in a list) when these items **do not have direct, standard `<a>` tag links**. This block is used when clicks are handled by JavaScript, and the agent needs to understand the *goal* of opening each item to proceed.

Instead of finding and following direct URLs, you provide a goal, and the AI agent intelligently interacts with the page elements to open each item and save its content as a separate result.

## Purpose

Use the `Open sub-pages` block in specific scenarios where standard link-finding is not applicable:

* **JavaScript-Driven Navigation:** The primary use case. For example, clicking on product cards in a catalog that trigger a page change via JavaScript, rather than having a direct `<a href="...">` link.
* **Opening a List of Similar Items:** When you need to process a list of visually similar items like products, search results, or profiles, and the action to open each is a click on the element itself.

<Note>
For most navigation tasks where elements are standard links (`<a>` tags with `href` attributes), the combination of **`Find Links` + `Follow Links`** is faster and more precise. Use `Open sub-pages` for more complex, JavaScript-based list navigation.
</Note>

## Configuration

### 1. What pages do you want to open?

This is the primary text field where you describe the criteria for the items the agent should open. This is a goal-oriented prompt.

Be clear and specific. For example: `open each product from the list`, `navigate to each job posting shown on the page`.

### 2. How many pages to extract?

This field sets a limit on the maximum number of matching items the agent will open.

If you set this to `10`, the agent will open a maximum of the first 10 items that match your criteria. The default is typically `5`.

### 3. How should pages be saved?

This dropdown determines the structure of your output results.

* **Multiple rows, one per page:** This is the standard option. For each sub-page the agent opens, it will create a new row in your results, making it easy to process them individually.
* **One combined result**  The agent will use AI to combine the data from each page.

## How It Works

1.  The workflow navigates to a starting page (e.g., a product category page via `Open Websites`).
2.  The `Open sub-pages` block is executed. The AI agent identifies clickable elements that match your description (e.g., "each product in the catalog").
3.  The agent interacts with each of these elements sequentially to navigate to the corresponding sub-page, up to the specified limit.
4.  For each new page visited, the agent captures its content.
5.  The block outputs a series of results, with each result corresponding to one of the opened sub-pages.

## Output Data Structure

The primary output of this block is a list of results. When set to **"Multiple rows, one per page"**, each result item will contain the content of an opened page. This data is then available as variables for subsequent blocks. The structure for each item will include:

* `url`: The URL of the sub-page that was opened.
* `content`: The full text content of that sub-page.

You can then use `{{url}}` and `{{content}}` in a subsequent `Extract Data` block to pull specific details from each item's page.

## Example: Opening Products from a JavaScript Catalog

Imagine an e-commerce category page where clicking a product image (which is not a standard link) navigates to the product page.

1.  **`Open Websites` Block:**
    * URL: `https://example-shop.com/catalog/shoes`
2.  **`Open sub-pages` Block (added next):**
    * **What pages do you want to open?:** `open each product from the catalog`
    * **How many pages to extract?:** `12`
    * **How should pages be saved?:** `Multiple rows, one per page`
3.  **(Optional) `Extract Data` Block (added next):**
    * You could add this block to process the `{{content}}` of each product page.

**Result:** The workflow will open up to 12 product pages by simulating clicks on the catalog items and will create a separate result row for each page's content and URL.

## Key Considerations

* **Use Case Specificity:** This block is a specialized tool. **Prefer the `Find Links` + `Follow Links` pattern** for all standard navigation tasks involving `<a>` tags.
* **Goal-Oriented Interaction:** The success of this block relies on the AI's ability to understand your goal ("open each product") and identify the correct interactive elements on the page.
* **Simplified Workflow:** For its specific use case, this block simplifies a potentially complex `Interact with Page` -> `Extract Data` loop into a single, easy-to-configure step.

The `Open sub-pages` block is an advanced tool for handling modern, JavaScript-heavy websites where traditional link-finding methods may not apply.
